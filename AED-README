Format of network config folder
----------------------------------
I have a sample config in the following folder "archieExp/AddAcl". Here AddAcl is a sample network. This folder shows the input-config folder should be formatted for my tool.
- This folder has a sub-directory called "configs". This (AddAcl/configs) has a list of router config files.
- It has another sub-directory "logs". Here you need to create a file called "verified.txt". This file(AddAcl/logs/verified.txt) has the list of policies that needs to be implemented in the config. The format of the policy is as follows: 
	smt-reachability srcIps=["<src-ip>"], dstIps=["<dst-ip>"], ingressNodeRegex=<src-router>, finalNodeRegex=<dst-router>
  AddAcl/logs/verified.txt has some examples of these policies (For my parser to work properly, I need the whitespace and commas to be exactly like shown in the example)

All my scripts mainly take a MainFolder as input. The MainFolder has a list of networks. For example, if microsoft have 3 networks - Mic1, Mic2, Mic3. Then all these will be subdirectory of another folder - lets say 'MicrosoftNetwork'. And this folder is usually given as input to my script.

Next I'll list what script, you'll need to run for support different management objective

Min change objective:
------------------------
This objective is to minimize number of changes made. 
Run the following script: ./minchange.sh <NETWORKS>
Here, NETWORKS folder will have a list of sub-directory, each represent a separate network. For example, archieExp folder has two subdirectories representing two networks "AddAcl" and "AddAcl2".

This script will create a file called "runoutput". This file will tell me how long it took AED to run and how many changes did it made, for each network. 
Output format: network,runtime,penalty-of-violating-soft-constraints

Maintain template objective:
------------------------
This objective is to maintain ACL and RouteFilter template.
Run the following script: ./mintempchng.sh <NETWORKS>
This script will create a file called "runoutput".

Min device affected objective:
------------------------
This objective is to minimize the no. of devices changed.
Run the following script: ./mindevchng.sh <NETWORKS>
This script will create a file called "runoutput" and "runoutput-devchng". The "runoutput-devchng" file will tell me how many devices were changed

Min forwarding objective:
------------------------
This objective is to minimize the no. of data-forwarding changes. For this, you need to provide two input folders.
Run the following script: ./minfwdchng.sh <NETWORKS-1> <NETWORKS-2>
This script will create a file called "runoutput"

Here, NETWORKS-2 has the list of networks that you want AED to modify. NETWORKS-1 has the same set of networks, but the "verified.txt" files of these networks only consists of policies that are already satisfied. In all other scenarios (including NETWORKS-2 of this example), the "verified.txt" files had both policies already satisfied and policies we want to additionally satisfy. [My script is first doing some preprocessing on NETWORKS-1 to find out how datafwd was happening to support existsing policies]
